                            <p class="intro__text">Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a dystopian futuristic setting that tends to focus on a
                                "combination of low-life and high tech" featuring advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as artificial intelligence and 
                                cybernetics, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order. Much of cyberpunk is rooted in the New Wave science
                                fiction movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when writers like Philip K. Dick, Roger Zelazny, John Brunner, J. G. Ballard, Philip José Farmer
                                and Harlan Ellison examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution while avoiding the utopian tendencies of 
                                earlier science fiction.</p>

                            Richard K. Morgan’s debut novel won the Philip K. Dick Award the same year. The book was adapted into a Netflix series beginning in 2018,
                            but before that, it stood out as a callback to “classic” cyberpunk with the flash, surrealism, and pulp-like action that suggests. The world of 
                            Morgan’s hero Takeshi Kovacs is one of modular minds: during people’s lives, their memories and minds are “backed up” to a cartridge that sits
                            inside their spinal column, and that piece can be used to restore their life to another body or “sleeve.”
                            Kovacs is a detective of sorts within an exploitative and hard-boiled society, and as is the case today, his society has arbitrary 
                            limits on the technology that exists. These edge cases are where Kovacs finds his work. Morgan gestures at the future of cloud computing in
                            the way rich people are able to offload storage of their minds to remote facilities they can access anytime. (It’s true: the cloud is just an
                            adaptation of longtime responsible corporate data backup policy.)
